# Auction-Organization

Auction Program:

Users must be signed in. No anonymous bidding
Bidding system on a time limit. Creates more hype and desparation and won't prolong bidding.
Vendors can set a starting price or let the market decide starting at $0.
No option to buy it now

Notification to all people who bidded on an auction if there is a new bid and by whom (more dramatic that way)
1 bid per 2 minutes to prevent spam and have people make more calculated bids (sniping allowed but counteracted by people pricing their bids higher because of the 2 min window)

Browising auctions should be algorithmically displayed by what's the most popular to the least popular
Include a sorting system to change this view

Some sort of prestige system or ranking or leaderboard or verification check mark for fun idk

maybe some other things
